# FHI-aims workflows

This repository contains a set of workflows written for [FHI-aims](https://fhi-aims.org) quantum chemistry code 
using [Jobflow](https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/) library in a way employed 
by [Atomate2](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2) software package.
